## üöÄ Backend Setup Instructions  

### Prerequisites  

Ensure the following are installed:  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Django 3.1.7 or higher  
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher  

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository_url>  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the backend directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd clarity_backend  
   ```  

3. Set up PostgreSQL:  
   - Create a database named `django`.  
   - Create a user named `django` with password `django`.  
   - Grant all privileges to the `django` database.  
   - Update the `settings.py` file to reflect your database credentials. Alternatively, switch to `sqlite3` for development.  

4. Create a virtual environment and activate it:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  

5. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

6. Run migrations to set up the database schema:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py migrate  
   ```  

7. Create a superuser for admin access:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py createsuperuser  
   ```  

8. Start the development server:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py runserver  
   ```  

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
